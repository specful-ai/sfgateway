list requests

Change `gateway/main.go` to handle HTTP GET requests to `/_list`.
It queries the `requests` table and renders a HTML table as the response.
Newest requests appear on the top.
The HTML table should have four columns: ID, Time, Request, Response.
The Time column should be in the format of `2006-01-02 15:04:05 -07:00`.
The Request column is the first 30 characters of the actual request text.
The Response column is the first 30 characters of the actual response text.
Both the Request column and the Response column should use `<pre>` tags to wrap the request/response texts.
